Category: execution | Subtype: execution of reverse shell

Purpose: Recommended actions when logs indicate execution of reverse shell under execution.

TLDR: Follow containment, investigation, eradication, and hardening steps.

High level actions:
- TLDR: Identify and stop malicious processes and scripts. Collect evidence before removal.
- Confirm: Inspect process trees, recent exec events, and unusual shells or interpreters.
- Contain: Kill malicious processes, isolate the host from the network if needed.
- Investigate: Pull bash history and auditd logs for execve events and parent pids.
- Eradicate and recover: Remove scripts, binaries, and crontab entries. Reimage if integrity is uncertain.
- Hardening: AppArmor or SELinux policies, allowlist execution, and monitor for encoded commands like base64.

Subtype specific steps:
- Inspect parent process chain and network connections.

Useful commands:
$ ps aux --sort=-start_time | head -n 20
$ pstree -ap | head -n 40
$ lsof -nPi | grep ESTABLISHED

Notes: Adjust commands for your distro. Preserve evidence before altering the system for forensics when severity is high.
