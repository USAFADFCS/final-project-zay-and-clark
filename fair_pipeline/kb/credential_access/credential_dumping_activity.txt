Category: credential access | Subtype: credential dumping activity

Purpose: Recommended actions when logs indicate credential dumping activity under credential access.

TLDR: Follow containment, investigation, eradication, and hardening steps.

High level actions:
- TLDR: Assume credential compromise and rotate secrets. Hunt for dumps and key theft.
- Confirm: Access to /etc/shadow or credential stores, password changes, and dump utilities.
- Contain: Lock impacted accounts and revoke tokens or sessions.
- Investigate: Scope which stores were touched and whether secrets were exfiltrated.
- Eradicate and recover: Remove dump tools, rotate all impacted credentials and keys.
- Hardening: Use PAM limits, secure boot, hardware-backed keys, and disable password logins.

Subtype specific steps:
- Search for dump tools, memory artifacts, or key theft utilities.

Useful commands:
$ sudo find / -iname 'laZagne*' -o -iname '*dump*' 2>/dev/null

Notes: Adjust commands for your distro. Preserve evidence before altering the system for forensics when severity is high.
