Category: credential access | Subtype: access to etc shadow or etc passwd

Purpose: Recommended actions when logs indicate access to etc shadow or etc passwd under credential access.

TLDR: Follow containment, investigation, eradication, and hardening steps.

High level actions:
- TLDR: Assume credential compromise and rotate secrets. Hunt for dumps and key theft.
- Confirm: Access to /etc/shadow or credential stores, password changes, and dump utilities.
- Contain: Lock impacted accounts and revoke tokens or sessions.
- Investigate: Scope which stores were touched and whether secrets were exfiltrated.
- Eradicate and recover: Remove dump tools, rotate all impacted credentials and keys.
- Hardening: Use PAM limits, secure boot, hardware-backed keys, and disable password logins.

Subtype specific steps:
- Assume credential compromise and force password resets immediately.

Useful commands:
$ sudo ausearch -f /etc/shadow -ts recent

Notes: Adjust commands for your distro. Preserve evidence before altering the system for forensics when severity is high.
