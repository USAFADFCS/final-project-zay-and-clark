Category: collection | Subtype: archiving data for exfiltration

Purpose: Recommended actions when logs indicate archiving data for exfiltration under collection.

TLDR: Follow containment, investigation, eradication, and hardening steps.

High level actions:
- TLDR: Stop staged data collection and secure sensitive files.
- Confirm: Access to sensitive paths, tar or zip archives, or credential dumps.
- Contain: Kill staging processes and restrict file access. Lock accounts involved.
- Investigate: Identify scope of data touched and whether staging directories exist.
- Eradicate and recover: Remove archives and malware. Notify stakeholders if sensitive data was exposed.
- Hardening: Implement file access monitoring and limit read permissions.

Subtype specific steps:
- Search for large tar or zip files in temp and user directories.

Useful commands:
$ sudo find /tmp /var/tmp ~ -type f -size +50M -name '*.tar*' -o -name '*.zip'

Notes: Adjust commands for your distro. Preserve evidence before altering the system for forensics when severity is high.
