Category: impact or destruction | Subtype: denial of service via resource exhaustion

Purpose: Recommended actions when logs indicate denial of service via resource exhaustion under impact or destruction.

TLDR: Follow containment, investigation, eradication, and hardening steps.

High level actions:
- TLDR: Preserve evidence while stopping further damage. Treat as major incident.
- Confirm: Ransomware notes, mass deletion, unexpected reboots, or kernel panics.
- Contain: Isolate the host immediately. Do not mass reboot. Disable automation that spreads impact.
- Investigate: Capture volatile data if safe. Identify initial access and timeline.
- Eradicate and recover: Restore from known good backups, rotate keys, and patch vulnerabilities.
- Hardening: Backup immutability, segmentation, and tested incident runbooks.

Subtype specific steps:
- Identify the offending process and limit resources or block source traffic.

Useful commands:
$ top -b -n 1 | head -n 20
$ ss -s

Notes: Adjust commands for your distro. Preserve evidence before altering the system for forensics when severity is high.
