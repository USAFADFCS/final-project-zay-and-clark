Category: reconnaissance | Subtype: network scan for open ports

Purpose: Recommended actions when logs indicate network scan for open ports under reconnaissance.

TLDR: Follow containment, investigation, eradication, and hardening steps.

High level actions:
- TLDR: Identify probing activity and enumerate affected assets to prepare for potential follow on actions.
- Confirm: Look for repeated connection attempts across many ports or services from the same source.
- Contain: Rate limit and block abusive IPs. Increase logging on targeted services.
- Investigate: Review IDS and Zeek or Suricata logs for scan patterns and service probes.
- Eradicate and recover: Not typically needed unless a service was misconfigured or exposed.
- Hardening: Close unused ports, enforce least privilege, and hide version banners.

Subtype specific steps:
- Block or rate limit the scanner. Verify that no sensitive services are exposed.

Useful commands:
$ grep -i 'SYN' /var/log/ufw.log | tail -n 100
$ zeek -r capture.pcap  # if packet capture exists

Notes: Adjust commands for your distro. Preserve evidence before altering the system for forensics when severity is high.
