Category: reconnaissance | Subtype: enumerating installed packages

Purpose: Recommended actions when logs indicate enumerating installed packages under reconnaissance.

TLDR: Follow containment, investigation, eradication, and hardening steps.

High level actions:
- TLDR: Identify probing activity and enumerate affected assets to prepare for potential follow on actions.
- Confirm: Look for repeated connection attempts across many ports or services from the same source.
- Contain: Rate limit and block abusive IPs. Increase logging on targeted services.
- Investigate: Review IDS and Zeek or Suricata logs for scan patterns and service probes.
- Eradicate and recover: Not typically needed unless a service was misconfigured or exposed.
- Hardening: Close unused ports, enforce least privilege, and hide version banners.

Subtype specific steps:
- No extra steps

Useful commands:
$ echo 'No specific commands'

Notes: Adjust commands for your distro. Preserve evidence before altering the system for forensics when severity is high.
