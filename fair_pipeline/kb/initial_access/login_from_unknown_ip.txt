Category: initial access | Subtype: login from unknown ip

Purpose: Recommended actions when logs indicate login from unknown ip under initial access.

TLDR: Follow containment, investigation, eradication, and hardening steps.

High level actions:
- TLDR: Block the entry point, validate accounts and keys, review network ingress, and rotate any exposed secrets.
- Confirm: Check auth logs for Accepted or Failed entries and unusual sources. Validate new users or keys.
- Contain: Disable or lock suspicious accounts, revoke tokens, and block source IPs at the firewall.
- Investigate: Review process trees and recent logins. Correlate with IDS or SIEM alerts.
- Eradicate and recover: Remove backdoors, rotate credentials, and reinstall compromised services if needed.
- Hardening: Enforce key based SSH, disable password auth, enable MFA where possible, and rate limit via fail2ban or UFW.

Subtype specific steps:
- Validate whether the source is expected. If not, lock the account and rotate credentials.

Useful commands:
$ last -ai | grep -v 'known_subnet'

Notes: Adjust commands for your distro. Preserve evidence before altering the system for forensics when severity is high.
